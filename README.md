## Documentation ðŸ› 
- [Architecture]()
  Model View ViewModel. This separates our views from business logic. It makes the different code component testable, loosely coupled and maintainable.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  The project is native android and has been developed with 95.9% kotlin
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
  Coroutines were used to allow asynchronous request with the ability to manage the different threads available
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow)
  Used stateFlow to facilitate state updated from the ViewModel and state observation and consumption on the fragment side
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) 
      View models have been used to stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes and manage communication with the data layer through the domain
    - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)
      Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
    - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
      SQLite object mapping library that allows us to do local caching, reduce number of API calls in future and improve overall data fetch speeds for duplicate requests
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) -
    Public Holiday uses [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) to manage its dependencies.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Coding Guidelines]()
   - [Coding Style](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide)
     In the development process, there was a high emphasis on following the standard recommended coding structure guideline, naming conventions and resource management (Styling, themes, custom fonts and strings)
   - [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint)
     ktlint aims to enforce the official Kotlin coding conventions and Android Kotlin Style Guide
   - [lint](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint)
     Checks your Android project source files for potential bugs and optimization improvements for correctness, security, performance, usability, accessibility, and internationalization
- [Testing]()
   - [UI Testing]()
     In [androidTest](app/src/androidTest/java/com/holiday/) you'll find a suite of UI tests that test different aspects of the fragments, and local cache
   - [Unit Testing]()
     In [test](app/src/test/java/com/holiday/) you'll find a suite of unit tests that tests multiple sections of the app such as ViewModels and data class mappers
